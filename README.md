# Chaos Lab

A public diary of code experiments, errors, and occasional brilliance.

This repository is my personal coding journal, a place where I dump scripts, ideas, and tests as I learn new things. There's no clear structure (yet), just chaos that may make sense over time. Maybe one day a pattern will emerge... or maybe not 😅

## What’s in here?

- Random scripts written while learning — mostly Python (for now)  
- Exercises based on tutorials, courses, or random ideas  
- Eventually, other techy stuff as I explore new areas  
- All code is written (or rewritten) by me — even if inspired by external material  

## Why?

Because the best way to learn is by doing, redoing, breaking, and lots of Googling.  
This repo helps me track my progress, mistakes, and small victories —  
and keeps my code from getting lost in random folders.

## Disclaimer

The code here is just for learning, failing, fixing, and growing. Since this is diary, expect some errors, corrections and fixes — it’s all part of the learning journey. 
You’ll also find a lot of comments in the code, as I tend to comment heavily, especially when I’m figuring things out.

**Some scripts may involve security, networking, or other sensitive topics and are provided for educational and ethical use only.  
Please use all code responsibly and within the bounds of the law.**

Nonetheless, feel free to look around, reuse, or fork anything — but don’t expect perfection.
